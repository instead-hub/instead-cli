To pass internal command to STEAD use `/` prefix. Some internal commands:

* `/act 1` (or just `1`) — interact with object in room (if object has `tak` field, it is activated; otherwise, `act` field (if defined) is activated)

  ```bash
  $ instead-cli fantasy-game
  Room

  The lever(1) on the wall is raised.

  > /act 1
  The lever(1) on the wall is lowered.

  > 1
  The lever(1) on the wall is raised.

  >
  ```

* `/use 1 2` (or just `1,2`) — use item from inventory on another item of inventory or object in room

  ```bash
  $ instead-cli apple-game
  Room

  The apple(1) is lying on the floor. The table(2) stands in the
  corner.

  > 1
  /I take the apple./

  The table(1) stands in the corner.

  ** Apple(2)

  > 2,1
  The table(1) stands in the corner. The apple(2) lies on the table.

  >
  ```

* `/go 1` (or just `1`)

  ```bash
  $ instead-cli game/
  Room

  The lever(1) on the wall is raised.

  >

  >> Kitchen(2)

  > /go 2
